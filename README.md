## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the **Instituto Federal do Amazonas (IFAM)** with a dedicated focus on the practical application of Machine Learning. I am passionate about leveraging software engineering principles and data science methodologies to build intelligent, real-world solutions.

My journey is driven by a deep curiosity for the entire ML lifecycle—from ideation and data analysis to deployment and monitoring. Outside of technology, I am an avid enthusiast of Hip-Hop culture.

## 🎯 Current Focus

My goal is to become an expert in building robust, scalable, and reliable ML systems. Currently, I am deepening my expertise in:
- **End-to-End Machine Learning Lifecycle:** Mastering the process from data analysis and model training to production deployment and MLOps.
- **MLOps Principles:** Implementing practices for automation, containerization, and monitoring to ensure models are maintainable and performant over time.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects where I have applied my skills to solve practical problems, primarily using concepts from the "Machine Learning Bookcamp".

### 🚢 End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction Service
Developed a complete web service to predict customer churn probability. The solution includes a trained `Scikit-learn` model, a `Flask` API for real-time predictions, and is containerized with `Docker` for portability and seamless deployment.
- **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Model Training, API Development (REST), Containerization (Docker), MLOps Principles.
- **Technologies:** `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Flask`, `Gunicorn`, `Docker`.
- **➡️ [View on GitHub]** *(<-- )*

### 🚗 Predictive Model for Used Car Prices
Engineered a Linear Regression model to estimate the market value of used cars based on their features. This project involved a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), rigorous data cleaning, and strategic feature engineering to improve model accuracy.
- **Key Skills Demonstrated:** Regression Modeling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering.
- **Technologies:** `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn`.
