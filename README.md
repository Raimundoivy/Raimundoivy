## Technical Synopsis

I am a Computer Science sophomore at the **Instituto Federal do Amazonas (IFAM)** with a dedicated focus on the engineering challenges of operationalizing machine learning models. My coursework and personal projects are centered on moving beyond theoretical concepts to architect, build, and deploy functional ML systems.

My guiding principle is to master the entire MLOps lifecycle‚Äîfrom data validation and model training to containerized deployment and inference‚Äîdemonstrating a practical, hands-on approach to creating scalable data products.

### Demonstrated Competencies
- **ML System Design:** Architecting project pipelines that include data validation, feature engineering, model training, and inference serving.
- **Model Deployment (MLOps):** Gaining practical experience in containerization with Docker and deploying models as scalable microservices via RESTful APIs.
- **Statistical Modeling:** Applying regression and classification algorithms to build predictive models, grounded in rigorous exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
- **Backend Integration:** Constructing API servers (Flask, Gunicorn) to serve model predictions for real-world applications.

## Featured Engineering Projects

A selection of projects demonstrating the design and implementation of production-oriented ML systems.

### üö¢ End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction Service
An operationalized microservice designed to predict customer churn in real-time. This project implements a full MLOps workflow, from model training and serialization to a containerized API deployment.

- **System Architecture:**
    - A `Scikit-learn` classification model trained on historical data.
    - Model and preprocessing pipeline serialized into a single artifact for consistent transformations.
    - A `Flask` application exposing a `/predict` RESTful endpoint for low-latency inference.
    - Containerized via `Docker` with a `Gunicorn` WSGI server for concurrent request handling and reproducible deployment.
- **Technologies:** `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Flask`, `Gunicorn`, `Docker`.
- **Repository:** **[Raimundoivy/ClientChurnPrediction](https://github.com/Raimundoivy/ClientChurnPrediction)**

### üöó Predictive Analytics for Used Vehicle Valuation
Engineered a regression model to estimate the market value of used vehicles. The primary focus was on rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and a systematic approach to model validation.

- **Key Technical Contributions:**
    - Executed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key value drivers and outliers.
    - Developed a data cleaning and feature engineering pipeline using `Pandas` and `NumPy` to handle missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
    - Trained and validated a Linear Regression model, analyzing feature importance and model performance metrics.
- **Technologies:** `Python`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
- **Repository:** **[Raimundoivy/CarPricePredictionUsingLinearRegression](https://github.com/Raimundoivy/CarPricePredictionUsingLinearRegression)**
